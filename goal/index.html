		Any money raised will eventually be used to afford college or stream related things, depending on the type of donation. Bits and Subs go straight to my savings account, and PayPal donations go to PayPal. I will manually add bits and subs to do the donation bar, as StreamLabs does not allow to combine all 3. As a bonus, every $100 over $480 will add another All Castles & Fortresses, Small Only run to the event.

		The goal was hit! Thank you very much everyone. The 480 Exit stream will be on Saturday, June 16th. I've lowered the additional run cost to $48 each, valid until i finish the last run.
