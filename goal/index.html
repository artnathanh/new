		<h1>Goal</h1>
		<p>
		What's poppin? This goal is set to end before SGDQ but if it gets close before I'll probably do it anyways. Any money raised will eventually be used to afford college or other related things. I will manually add bits and subs to do the donation bar, as StreamLabs does not allow to combine all 3. As a bonus, every $100 over $480 will add another All Castles & Fortresses, Small Only run to the event.
